
This project aims to fit a variety of classification algorithms, which were taught to us in class. These were k-nearest neighbors (knn), support vector machines, and a wide variety of tree-based methods. Essentially a unique dataset was presented to each student and we would try to see which classification algorithm would perform the best at predicting the use of drugs by patients. We would have to apply a plethora of various methods which would be shown in the R code to help determine why this is the best classification model and then actually look on how well this would perform in the future against the test dataset. Overall, this was a fun project and help tremendously gaining a deeper understanding of the classification algorithms.
